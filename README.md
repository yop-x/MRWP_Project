# MRWP_Project
Students: Emiel Robben, Leah Dollo, Tim DÃ¶ring, YOOOOP

Idea: Lets make this our todo-list and slowly transition it into a workload distribution record

MOST URGENT:

    Check present sources in more detail, to see what useful information it contains
    Based on that, decide what to cut down on & What do focus on. Plan of action for our model?
    Based on that, find even more sources

FIRST STEPS - CODING

    Push relevant datasets to git (create "data" folder first)
    Read CSVs into suitable datastructure (nested list or dict), filter out or correct cells if necessary

FIRST STEPS - REPORT

    Create file (lol)
