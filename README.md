# MRWP_Project
Students: Emiel Robben, Leah Dollo, Tim DÃ¶ring, YOOOOP

Idea: Lets make this our todo-list and slowly transition it into a workload distribution record

UPDATES:
    - We decided to focus on Zurich (instead of all of Switzerland)
    - How did gouvernment restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic affect first year student's ability to find new friends? An ABM model combined with
      a social network, simulating the case of Zurich based on real data.

MOST URGENT:

    1) Check present sources in more detail, to see what useful information they contain
    2) Based on that, decide what to cut down on & What do focus on. Plan of action for our model?
    3) Based on that, find even more sources

FIRST STEPS - CODING

    1) Push relevant datasets to git (create "data" folder first)
    2) Read CSVs into suitable datastructure (nested list or dict), filter out or correct cells if necessary

FIRST STEPS - REPORT
    1) Look up source 9 (pwp) for current limitations on combining ABMs with Social Networks
